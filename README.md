# METACRAFTERS-SOLIDITY-ASSESSMENT

# Project: Create a Token

# Code Requirements
1. The contract will include public variables to store information about the coin, such as its name, abbreviation, and total supply.
2. It will maintain a mapping that associates addresses with their respective balances (address => uint).
3. A mint function will be implemented, which accepts an address and a value as parameters. This function will increase the total supply by the specified value and also increase the balance of the given address by the same amount.
4. Additionally, there will be a burn function that functions oppositely to the mint function. It will take an address and a value as inputs, then decrease both the total supply and the balance of the specified address by the given value.
5. The burn function will include conditions to ensure that the account balance is at least as much as the amount to be burned before proceeding.
